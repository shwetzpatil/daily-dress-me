# Daily Dress Me
This web-app is a simple service that recommends clothing to wear based on the weather. It uses jQuery, Bootstrap 4, Darksky API and Google Places API for its functionality. It also uses http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to deal with CORS-related issues with respect to Darksky API.

The web-app uses temperature, gender and general weather conditions for making the recommendation.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open index.html in your browser.

## Future work
1. Make the recomendation more expressive e.g. based on occasion.
2. Allow for some selection of present wardrobe collection to improve recommendations.
